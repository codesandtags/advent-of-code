# Advent of code

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Here are documenting my solutions to the puzzles.
